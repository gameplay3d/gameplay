/** \mainpage GamePlay - 3D Game Framework
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * GamePlay is a cross-platform, C++, 3D gaming framework that includes a runtime library, tools,
 * and learning content that allows developers to write games for leading-edge mobile and desktop
 * environments without worrying about platform details.

 * \section Project Details
 *
 * The GamePlay C++ runtime library offers a simple, well-defined, 3D gaming framework that's
 * designed to get the most out of today's mobile and desktop platforms. Its purpose is to help you
 * create stunning, world-class, games that harness the power and performance of the platform without
 * being concerned about the platform details. This is accomplished through a set of C++ classes that
 * are built on top of the OS, providing access to the hardware, graphics, and audio libraries
 * (including EGL, OpenGL ES 2.0, and OpenAL 1.1). These classes allow you to:
 *
 * <b>Build your game without worrying about platform details</b>
 * \li Drive your game with application initialization, update, and render callbacks.
 * \li Control your game with touch screen, keyboard and accelerometer handlers.
 * \li Manage your game with control over the device's file system.
 *
 * <b>Create game components with ease</b>
 * \li Add visuals with scene, camera, light, model, mesh, texture, sprite, materials, animation, and physics classes.
 * \li Control and position the game using the viewport, camera, and audio listener.
 * \li Manage fundamental elements such as fonts, colors, and curves.
 * \li Update game data with built-in math classes for vectors, matrices, rays, planes, and their associated operations.
 *
 * <b>Improve your game and learn</b>
 * \li Supports TrueType fonts and the Khronos COLLADA and FBX interchange formats to import and binary encode your 3D game assets.
 * \li Built-in materials and shaders to enhance your game's objects.
 * \li Both mobile and desktop platforms are supported for ease of portability.
 * \li Documentation, tutorials, and code samples are provided.
