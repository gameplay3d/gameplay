1. Obtaining and using the COLLADA DOM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two locations where the COLLADA DOM can be downloaded.

If you are a registered PLAYSTATION(R)3 developer you should always
download and use the COLLADA DOM package from PS3(TM) DevNet 
(https://ps3.scedev.net/) The COLLADA DOM packages released on 
PS3(TM) DevNet have been tested by Sony for compatibility with 
PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK releases.  Licenses for all software included in 
the PS3(TM) DevNet package are reviewed and cleared by Sony for 
use with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK.

The main Open Source development site for the COLLADA DOM is 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom this site will always 
contain the most up-to-date version of the COLLADA DOM for all 
platforms.  Packages of stable and beta versions of the COLLADA DOM 
will be available in the download section.  The absolute latest
untested development code is available by Subversion checkout.  
Sony DOES NOT test or support the COLLADA DOM release from SourceForge.
If you use a SourceForge release be sure to carefully review all licenses 
to make sure they are compatible with your distribution and use of
the software. You can obtain support from the COLLADA developer
community on the SourceForge site or from the wiki and forums on 
COLLADA.org. 

Because the PS3(TM) DevNet release of the COLLADA DOM is tested and
reviewed by Sony it will usually be slightly older than the release 
on SourceForge. Some files may be added or removed to insure 
compatibility for PLAYSTATION(R)3 use.  See (5) below for details.
